# Bootcamp: Data Science Analyst

## Module 2: Data and Information

- Challenge - RStudio first contact

## Teaching Objectives

Practice the following concepts covered in the Module:
1. Find out what the term Data Wrangler is.
2. Having a first contact with the R language.
3. Have a first contact with RStudio.
4. Consume data from SIDRAR API.

## Statement

In this practice we will use the **R language** to evaluate Data Wrangler techniques.

Data Wrangler is the process of transforming and manipulating raw data (raw data) to another format in order to improve the visibility of the information. With this process it is possible to build graphs, apply statistical functions, between others.

Through the SIDRAR package, we will use the R language to collect data from the IBGE database. This package is very interesting for those who need work with the institution's data and research, such as the Continuous PNAD, PME, PMC, National Accounts

## Activities

1. Using the R language, perform Data Wrangling practice. You need have a version of R at least equal to 4.1.

2. Copy the code from: [Access the Code](code.r)

3. Run the code in RStudio IDE or RStudio Cloud.

4. Analyze the results by applying the functions:
    - select()
    - mutate()
    - filter()
    - group_by()
    - sumarize()
